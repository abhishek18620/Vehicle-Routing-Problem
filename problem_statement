The VRPSD is a variation of the classical VRP, where each customer can be served by more
than one vehicle. Thus, for the VRPSD, besides the delivery routes, the amount to be
delivered to each customer in each vehicle must also be determined. The option of splitting
a demand makes it possible to service a customer whose demand exceeds the vehicle
capacity. Splitting may also allow decreasing costs. The vehicle routing problem with time
windows and split deliveries (VRPTWSD) is an extension of the VRPSD, adding to it the
time window restraints.
